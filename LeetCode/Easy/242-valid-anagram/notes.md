## [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/)

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

simple sort and compare will suffice.

sorting is O(n.log.n) time so time complexity is O(n.log.n)
space complexity is O(1) because the function does not store any of its own values.
