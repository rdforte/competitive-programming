# Binary Search Tree
is essentially just a Binary Tree meaning that each node can have up to 2 nodes.
The difference is in the ordering.

The left node is always less than the parent node.
The right node is always greater than the parent node.

This holds true as we move up/down the tree as subsequent nodes have to 
follow this rule.
